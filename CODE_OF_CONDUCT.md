## Responsibilities and Enforcement

***FILL THIS OUT PER PROJECT***

## Protections

All contributors and maintainers are to be warned, with detailed explanation and citation of their CoC violation, and be asked to correct it, before corrective or disciplinary action is made against them, excluding cases of generally illegal activity. This exception is intended to cover situations such as hacking into another contributor or maintainers device, assault or battery against another contributor or maintainer, etc. It is not intended to cover petty crime or misdemeanors unrelated to this project.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct only applies within the project space. That should be pretty obvious. If it's not to you, think long and hard about how and why this project would have any authority over others lives.
